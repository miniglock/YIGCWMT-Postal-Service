# Postalforce - Postal Community

## Project Description

YIGCWMT Postal Service is a Salesforce CRM Application and Experience Cloud Portal which allows employees to create and track and customers to track packages on their path through the delivery process. Employees can log into the application and depending on their profile and role have access to those data and features required to perform their work. Customers can log into the Experience Cloud Portal and track their packages, submit web-to-case forms, and submit missing and insured packages for insurance refunds in order to reduce the strain on employees and improve productivity.
